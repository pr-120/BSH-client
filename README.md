# INSTALLATION
The application can be installed by executing the `complete_installation.sh` script located in the root of the application. The python virtual environment needed for the openSenseMap will be installed as well as any other system packages needed. As the application was designed for raspberry Pis which used the Debian 12 (bookworm) distribution, the only necessary package was the `libcurl4-openssl-dev`. When using another distribution the user might need to install any additional necessary packages.
